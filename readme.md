# ITMD361_project1
1st project in ITMD361

Note prior to final submission:
I reduced all images by 50%, addressing one of the main concerns under my basecamp post
I fixed any syntax or grammatical errors, as highlighted by a comment under my basecamp post.
I renamed all files, folders, and the repository so that they are all lowercased. This addresses the Professor's first comment.
I updated ALT tags on all images to be more descriptive of what was on screen. This addresses the Professor's second comment.
I did not add descriptions or reviews to the anime page because I wanted it to be more like a gallery rather than a webpage with descriptions of each. I chose specific that would hopefully grab viwers attention. This addresses a comment under my basecamp post.
