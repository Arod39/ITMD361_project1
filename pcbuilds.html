    <h1>An Overview of PC's I've built</h1>
    <p>Having a gaming PC is a dream I had since I was about 12 or 13 years old. I always felt inspired and shocked when I would see the gaming rooms that many gamers and youtubers had throughout the year. As I've gotten older, I've had the chance to save up some money and finally take on the task of building a PC for the first time. For my very first build, I took a total of 12 hours building, and about 2 days of troubleshooting. Fast forward to today, I've built 4 PC's throughout the year, and I hope to build more.</p>
